This document describes the workaround for the resource_compiler on MS Windows


The resource compiler is not a C++ compiler, it is a compiler that translates
resource files, i.e. files that describe dialogs, strings, version information
and other parts of the GUI on MS Windows systems. 

The problem is that it includes files from the C/C++ include path, and 
STLport uses mechanisms the resource compiler can't handle, e.g. using macro
names longer than 31 characters. 

The workaround is to guard all affected headers (stdio.h, string.h, stdarg.h,
stdlib.h, ctype.h) against this. The resource compiler is detected by the 
macro RC_INVOKED.

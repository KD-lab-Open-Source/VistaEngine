The MinGW package is used as a default platform to
build different version of the STLport libraries.

- gcc (native compiler):

  Makefile : gcc.mak

    WARNING : If you use the shared version of the STLport
  libraries you have to define the _STLP_USE_DYNAMIC_LIB
  macro in order to have your executable linked correctly.

    If you want to build STLport using the Mingw package without
  help of the GNU tools coming with Msys use the --mingw
  configuration option.
